# CapturePad
By Matt Millheim


## Description:
CapturePad is an app where users can jot down events, tasks, and notes that they want to capture. Itâ€™s part journal and part todo app. My goal is to allow users to store these items with context and relationships to other items in a way that is searchable and, ultimately, useful for capturing thoughts, the events in their lives, and the important tasks that they want to do, and recalling them later.

I am building this app using Django for the backend and React for the frontend.
